information theory, a mathematical representation of the conditions and parameters affecting the transmission and processing of information.
Most closely associated with the work of the American electrical engineer Claude Shannon in the mid-20th century, 
information theory is chiefly of interest to communication engineers, though some of the concepts have been adopted and used in such fields as psychology and linguistics. 
Information theory overlaps heavily with communication theory, but it is more oriented toward the fundamental limitations on the processing and communication of information and less oriented toward the detailed operation of particular devices
